    "These tutorials cover more advanced topics. This guide assumes that you have read the [Basic User Guide](../basic_user_guide/basic_user_guide.ipynb), and it builds from those basics to cover more complex topics that will let you get the most out of the framework. Within each section, the tutorials are designed to be read in order, but each section is self-contained enough that you can choose to read only the sections that are useful to you.\n",
